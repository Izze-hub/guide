Astrokings quick guide

"Choose the roles of the ship types."

"When you conquer dimensions rift and gather materials, you'll enhance your regular ships. Ship enhancement involves specializing in weapons, engines, and armor for each of the four ship types. Enhancing them evenly results in mediocre Fleet, so it's best to focus on one type.

Ships specializing in weapons serve as the fleet's damage dealer. In Astrokings, the majority of fleet firepower relies on damage dealer, so if they're defeated, victory is almost certain for the opponent. Protect them at all costs.

Ships specializing in engines and armor improve defense and survivability, acting as shields to protect the damage dealer from enemy attacks. To protect them, arrange your formation so that shields take enemy attacks before the damage dealer. Be cautious, as your choice of enhancement strategy can limit the formations available. The order in which you receive attacks will be explained in the next section. This is essential knowledge if you're considering PvP battles, so make sure to learn it thoroughly."

“Attack order”

Cannons and railguns prioritize larger ships from the back row, while missiles and beams prioritize attacking smaller ships from the front row.

The fleet's size class is as follows:
Flagship > Battleship > Cruiser > Destroyer > Frigate

The attacking order is based on the size of the ships in the attacking row. For example, if using the Cannon Barrage formation, the opponent's cannons and railguns will attack in the following order: Flagship > Cruiser > Battleship. Although the Battleship is larger than the Cruiser, in the Cannon Volley formation, the Battleship is positioned in the center, so the Cruiser, located behind the Battleship, is prioritized.

Similarly, when using the Missile Barrage formation, the opponent's missiles and beams will attack in the following order: Flagship > Frigate > Destroyer. The Flagship is the largest ship but is positioned at the front, so it will be attacked before the Frigate and Destroyer.

As a practice exercise, when using the formations provided below, consider the order in which the opponent's missiles (beams) will attack. The correct answers are provided in the folded sections. Note that for cannons (railguns), the order is reversed.

The text mentions that the correct answers for the practice exercise are provided in the folded sections, but those sections are not included in the provided text.

“To be honest this part hard to understand lets just skip this”


“Choosing main weapons”

"In Astrokings, there are four types of weapons: Railgun (Frigate), Beam (Destroyer), Missile (Cruiser), and Cannon (Battleship). Generally, Missiles and Cannons are the most popular and widely used weapons, with a larger user base.

Railgun and Beam have their strengths, but they are generally more specialized and suitable for advanced players. It's better not to delve into them until you've mastered either Cannon or Missile.

Here are the characteristics of Cannons and Missiles:

Advantages of Missiles:

Well-balanced in terms of range, attack power, and rate of fire, with no significant drawbacks.
Can be positioned in the center in most formations, allowing for versatility.
Suitable for fast defense formations, like pirate hunting.
Disadvantages of Missiles:

While missiles have good range, the Missile Barrage formation may fall short due to fleet positioning issues compared to the natural missile range.
Free-to-play Flagships suitable for missiles lack power in PvP battles. Fully capable missile Flagships are often difficult to obtain, such as through collaborations, and even when obtained, require significant investment to develop.
Overall, Missiles provide stability and are beginner-friendly.

Advantages of Cannons:

Highest attack power among the four weapon types.
Benefits more from rate of fire improvements, delivering high burst damage in rapid-fire mode.
Can utilize the excellent flagship Horus for dimension conquest.
#NOTE# For me personally dont get horus, get hecate instead its better than horus, horus are mediocre
 
Disadvantages of Cannons:

Lowest rate of fire among the four weapon types, heavily reliant on rate of fire-boosting flagships, formations, and skills.
Unable to use fast defense formations.
Requires significant investment for the development of Flagships like Triglaph and Ravana-C if you want to use them in PvP battles.
While Cannons are more specialized and peaky, they offer explosive power and are suitable for beginners to intermediate players.

Both weapon types have their merits, but I recommend Cannons for free-to-play players for several reasons. One of the main reasons is the synergy with Hecate, which is readily available to free-to-play players and excels in dimension conquest. If you focus on Cannon as your main weapon, you can also consider T6 promotions.

As free-to-play players may not have the resources to develop multiple Flagships, it's recommended to concentrate on Horus if you're choosing a single Flagship to develop. Before acquiring multiple Flagship heroes for PvP battles, prioritizing ship enhancement is essential. To ensure smooth dimension conquest, a Cannon-centric enhancement strategy with Hecate as the Flagship is a rational choice."
